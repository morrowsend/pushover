# pushover
## Pushover notifications for MotionEye OS on the Raspberry Pi.

Receive mobile push notifications generated by **[MotionEye OS](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos)** whenever movement has been detected by your Raspberry Pi camera module.

**Add tokens (app and user) before running!**

This script assumes you have a **Pushover account** (http://pushover.net), and have **paid for full access.** You will then be provided with your **app** and **user tokens**, which are _essential_ for this script to work.

Once you have them, substitute them in the relevant places in **pushover.py.** The simplest way to do this is:

    cd pushover
    sudo nano pushover.py

Then find the sections called **"token"** and **"user"** (which by default are called):

    "APP_TOKEN"
    "USER_TOKEN"

Once you have added your tokens:

    ctrl + x  # (to exit nano)
    y         # (to save)

You can then run the script via:

    ./pushover.py

However, to set up MotionEye OS you need to follow the **[Add Push Notifications to MotionEye OS](https://www.raspberrycoulis.co.uk/coding/add-push-notifications-motioneye-os/)** guide, which provides a more detailed overview of how to configure MotionEye OS to use your script.
